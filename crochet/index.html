    <h3> How I started </h3>
	<p> When I was in seventh grade, I tried knitting, which did not work out because I didn't have anyone to teach it to me. Also, my brother kept calling me a grandma. I took a break from needle work for a while and in September 2024, I started crocheting, which sounded a little less like something a grandma would do. My grandma's friend helped me learn.</p>
