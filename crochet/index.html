    <h3> How I started </h3>
	<p> In May of 2022, I tried knitting, which did not work out because I didn't have anyone to teach it to me. Also, my brother kept calling me a grandma. So I took a break from needlework and in September 2024, I started crocheting, which sounded a little less like something a grandma would do. Luckily, my grandma knew someone who helped me learn how to crochet, and now I can make a wide array of things, including coasters, granny squares, hats, and my favorite, plants. Now my brother respects my needlework hobby because he has seen all the cool things I have made (including a little stuffed sheep for him.) </p>
