    <h3> How I started </h3>
	<p> In May of 2022, I tried knitting, which did not work out because I didn't have anyone to teach it to me. Also, my brother kept calling me a grandma. I took a break from needlework and in September 2024, I started crocheting, which sounded a little less like something a grandma would do. Luckily, my grandma knew someone who helped me learn how to crochet, and now I can make a wide array of things, including coasters, granny squares, hats, and my favorite, plants. Now my brother respects my needlework hobby because he has seen all the cool things I have made (including a little stuffed sheep for him.) </p>
    <h3> Spotlight: Annette </h3>  
	  <p> Annette is my grandma's friend. She has been knitting and crocheting for a long time, so she is experienced in both fields of needlework. She is a very good teacher and helped me learn how to crochet. She also recommended various brands of yarn and hooks that would work well for my level of experience. </p>
    <h3> Knitting and Crocheting: There IS a Difference </h3>
	  <p> Some people think that knitting and crocheting are the same thing and can be used interchangeably. However, there are some differences. For starters, knitting uses two needles while crocheting uses one hook. There are various sizes for needles and hooks. The stitches are also different. If you look at the front of a blanket that was knitted, the stitches will be v-shaped. If the blanket was crocheted, the stitches would look more like knots. </p>
